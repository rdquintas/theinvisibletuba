                            <h3>Short Bio</h3>
                            <p>THE INVISIBLE TUBA is what happens when eight musicians from Portugal, Venezuela, the USA, the UK, and Italy
                                 meet in Lisbon and decide the world needs to be #happyrightnow. 
                                 With clarinet, banjo, trumpet, sax, trombone, bass, drums, and one fearless singer, they turn every gig into a party 
                                 — mixing roaring hot jazz with cheeky stage antics. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since their formation, THE INVISIBLE TUBA has been a hit with both festival audiences and 
                                the vintage dance community, known for turning every stage into a celebration.
                                With their tight musicianship, playful stage chemistry, and infectious energy,
                                they keep the music alive — not as a museum piece, but as a living, 
                                breathing party that sweeps audiences onto the dance floor.

                            <h3>Medium Bio</h3>                          
                            <p>THE INVISIBLE TUBA is an 8-piece jazz joy machine powered by banjo (Tó Pacheco), singer (Laura Venturini), trumpet (Simon White), sax (Francisco Menezes), trombone (Iris Ceulemans), bass (Heriberto Rojas), drums (Pedro Gens), 
                                and a clarinet player (Ricardo Quintas) who refuses to behave. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Based in Lisbon but assembled from Portugal, Venezuela, the USA (Wisconsin!), the UK, and Italy, 
                                they serve up the irresistible swing of 1920s New Orleans — spiced with international flair and a dash of mischief.
                                Their concerts are equal parts music and mayhem: a tight horn section locking in on classic hot jazz riffs, 
                                a rhythm section that makes it impossible not to dance, 
                                and spontaneous bits of comedy that catch the audience off guard (and sometimes the band, too).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whether in a grand theatre, a festival tent, or parading through the streets, 
                                THE INVISIBLE TUBA brings toe-tapping tunes, good-natured chaos, and just enough trouble 
                                to keep things interesting.

                            <h3>Full Bio</h3>
                            <p>THE INVISIBLE TUBA is an 8-piece international jazz band from Lisbon whose mission is simple: 
                                keep the music swinging and the audience smiling. 
                                The lineup reads like a United Nations of jazz — 
                                musicians from Portugal, Venezuela, the USA (Wisconsin), the UK, and Italy — 
                                armed with banjo (Tó Pacheco), singer (Laura Venturini), trumpet (Simon White), saxophone (Francisco Menezes), trombone (Iris Ceulemans), bass (Heriberto Rojas), drums (Pedro Gens), 
                                and a clarinet player (Ricardo Quintas) that’s as charming as he is unpredictable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They play the music of 1920s and 1930s New Orleans, but they don’t just play it — they live it, twist it, 
                                and occasionally trip over it in the most entertaining way possible. 
                                Their shows are a mix of roaring hot jazz, sharp musicianship, and comic moments that seem spontaneous… because they are. 
                                A trombone slide might “accidentally” wander into the singer’s space, 
                                the banjo might declare itself leader mid-song, or the clarinet might start a mock argument with the trumpet over who gets the melody.
                                Despite the onstage antics, the musicianship is deadly serious.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These are players who know their Jelly Roll from their Duke Ellington (it's not the mustache), 
                                and who can turn a dance floor into a time machine. 
                                The band’s repertoire swings between classic jazz standards, cheeky reworks of old favourites, movie soundtracks, video game classics 
                                and the occasional unexpected twist that leaves audiences grinning. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They’re a hit with vintage dance crowds, festival-goers, and anyone who believes music should be as fun as it is good.
                                Whether you see them in a theatre, on a festival stage, or marching down a Lisbon street in full parade mode, 
                                THE INVISIBLE TUBA delivers more than music — they deliver an experience. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One where the line between audience and band blurs, laughter mixes with applause, and everyone leaves a little happier than they arrived.

                                The band was formed around 2017 initially as a side project by musicians from the Lisbon jazz scene, but it quickly grew into something bigger.
                                They’ve played at festivals, theatres, and clubs across Portugal and beyond, here's a few highlights:
